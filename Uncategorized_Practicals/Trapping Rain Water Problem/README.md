# Rain Terraces (Trapping Rain Water) Problem

Given an array of non-negative integers representing terraces in an elevation map 
where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it is able to trap 
after raining.

## Examples

**Example #1**

```
Input: arr[] = [2, 0, 2]
Output: 2
Structure is like below:

| |
|_|

We can trap 2 units of water in the middle gap.
```

**Example #2**

```
Input: arr[] = [3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4]
Output: 10
Structure is like below:

     |
|    |
|  | |
|__|_| 

We can trap "3*2 units" of water between 3 an 2,
"1 unit" on top of bar 2 and "3 units" between 2 
and 4. See below diagram also.
```

**Example #3**

```
Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]
Output: 6
Structure is like below:

       | 
   |   || |
_|_||_||||||

Trap "1 unit" between first 1 and 2, "4 units" between
first 2 and 3 and "1 unit" between second last 1 and last 2.
```

## The Algorithm

An element of array can store water if there are higher bars on left and right. 
We can find amount of water to be stored in every element by finding the heights 
of bars on left and right sides. The idea is to compute amount of water that can
be stored in every element of array. For example, consider the array
`[3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4]`, We can trap "3*2 units" of water between 3 an 2, "1 unit" 
on top of bar 2 and "3 units" between 2 and 4. See below diagram also.

The concept is illustrated as shown:

**Steps**

- Find maximum height of bar from the left end up to an index `i` in the array `left_max`.
- Find maximum height of bar from the right end up to an index `i` in the array `right_max`.
- Iterate over the `height` array and update `answer`:
  - Add `min(max_left[i], max_right[i]) âˆ’ height[i]` to `answer`.

## Binary Search Tree
### A binary search tree (BST), which may sometimes also be called an ordered or
  sorted binary tree, is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the
  following properties: 1) The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with
  keys less than the node's key. 2) The right subtree of a node contains only
  nodes with keys greater than the node's key. 3) Both the left and right
  subtrees must also be binary search trees.
